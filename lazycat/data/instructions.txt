Use your mouse to control LazyCatat. Hold the left mouse button to fire their lasers at the LaserMice. Remember: LazyCat has a limit effective range! They won't fire their laser if there are no LaserMice nearby.

Keyboard controls are also available. If you're reading this, you've worked them out already.

If you're on a touch device, just use your fingers!
