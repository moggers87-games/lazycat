### Requirements

* Python 2.7/3 (might work on 2.6, haven't tested)
* PyGame (if using Python3, will need PyGame compiled for it)

### Running

Start the game with the following command:

    python -m lazycat

You can also install it via the usual method:

    python setup.py install

This will install a script `lazycat` to your `$PATH`, so you can just run:

    lazycat

Pass `--mute` or `-m` as an argument to mute the music, e.g.:

    lazycat --mute

### Playing

Control the cat with your (physical) mouse, quit is `q` or `esc`.

Get in range of a mouse and hold down a (physical) mouse button to shoot it
with your eye lazors!
