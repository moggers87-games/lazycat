## How to run

Load `index.html` in your favourite browser.

### Note

Some modern browsers block asset loading because of some weirdness with file:// URLs. If that's the case you can either disable such protection on your browser or run the following to create a mini HTTP server to host the game locally:

    python -m http.server --directory .

Then connect to http://127.0.0.1:8000
